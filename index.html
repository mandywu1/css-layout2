        <h2><a href="#" target="_blank">A Fresh Look at Modern & Contemporary Asian Art</a></h2>
        <p>K$20,000,000–30,000,000.Turning back towards his native China, Zao Wou-ki sought inspiration in oracle bones, Han-dynasty rubbings and the historical traditions of calligraphy and painting. Painted in 1954, the same year as Vent, Soleil brillant à travers la forêt is one of the earliest in the artist’s Oracle Bone series, and it is the only primarily red one created that year. This work impresses the viewer with the heat and brightness of the sun.     <p>Curabitur mi dolor, rutrum eget tincidunt ut, molestie vel lorem. Nullam vulputate lobortis nibh sed feugiat.

        <p>Liu Wei, The Revolutionary Family Series (triptych), 1994. Estimate HK$30,000,000–40,000,000.
Although The Revolutionary Family Series was recognised as Liu Wei’s signature early on, he only pursued it for a few years. The present triptych, which Liu Wei created on a special commission in 1994, represents the height of his early career. Its majestic composition is unseen elsewhere in his early oeuvre, and adding to its rarity, it comes with a unique hand-painted frame. The triptych is doubtlessly a masterpiece of Liu Wei’s early career and a museum-worthy masterwork of 1990s

        <h2><a href="#" target="_blank">Tanaka Atsuko, 90C, 1990. Estimate HK$1,800,000–2,800,000.</a></h2>
        <p>This mesmerising painting features jostling, pulsating circles that evoke the frenzied lights of Japan’s neon cityscape. An electrifying symphony celebrating the sublimity of life and interconnectivity, Tanaka’s omnipresent circles and lines are the culmination of her groundbreaking, career-long explorations in sound, performance, technology and mixed media.

        <h2><a href="#" target="_blank">Ai Weiwei, Grapes, 2012. Estimate HK$4,000,000–6,000,000</a></h2>
        <p>In 1997, Ai Weiwei began making antique, readymade furniture with Dadaist inflections in what would become the most symbolic series of his creative career. These works, of which Grapes is highly representative, have been prominently featured in many of the artist’s large-scale solo exhibitions.
